## Overview

This repository contains a robust, end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting personality types (Extrovert vs. Introvert) from behavioral survey data. The workflow includes advanced data cleaning, missing value imputation, class balancing, feature engineering, model selection, and ensemble learning. Built for the Kaggle Playground Series S, this project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for personality prediction.

## Installation

To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required packages.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/piunivesp49/Personality_Prediction_Pipeline.git
cd Personality_Prediction_Pipeline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the pipeline, execute the main script. Make sure to have your dataset ready in the specified format.

```bash
python main.py --data_path your_data.csv
```

Replace `your_data.csv` with the path to your behavioral survey data.

## Pipeline Components

### Data Cleaning

Data cleaning is essential for ensuring the quality of your dataset. This section covers techniques for removing duplicates, handling outliers, and normalizing data. 

#### Key Steps:

1. **Remove Duplicates**: Identify and remove any duplicate entries in the dataset.
2. **Outlier Detection**: Use statistical methods to identify and handle outliers.
3. **Normalization**: Scale the data to a standard range.

### Missing Value Imputation

Handling missing values is crucial for maintaining the integrity of your data. This section provides various imputation techniques, including:

- **Mean/Median Imputation**: Replace missing values with the mean or median of the column.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors**: Use KNN to estimate missing values based on similar data points.
- **Regression Imputation**: Predict missing values using regression models.

### Class Balancing

Class imbalance can lead to biased models. This section discusses techniques to balance the dataset, such as:

- **Oversampling**: Increase the number of instances in the minority class.
- **Undersampling**: Decrease the number of instances in the majority class.
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Use methods like SMOTE to create synthetic examples.

### Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into meaningful features. This section covers:

- **Creating New Features**: Derive new features from existing data.
- **Feature Selection**: Identify the most relevant features for model training.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Convert categorical variables into numerical formats.

### Model Selection

Choosing the right model is key to achieving good performance. This section includes:

- **Model Comparison**: Evaluate different models using cross-validation.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model parameters for better accuracy.
- **Performance Metrics**: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to assess model performance.

### Ensemble Learning

Ensemble methods combine multiple models to improve accuracy. This section covers:

- **Bagging**: Reduce variance by averaging predictions from multiple models.
- **Boosting**: Improve model performance by focusing on misclassified instances.
- **Stacking**: Combine different models to leverage their strengths.
